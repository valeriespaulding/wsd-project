			<p>Pictured, is Dutches; a blue nose, brindle Pitbull. This photo was taken as a pup, she is currently 3 years old and a mother of six. She gave birth to her litter on Feb. 15th, 2010. As a pup she was spunky, energetic and loved to beat up on the older dogs. She was quickly labeled the trouble maker of the house. As a mother, she is now still quite energetic, but much calmer. Her pups are even crazier than her and you will find them featured in the <a href="#gallery">gallery</a>. They arrived in the following order, the first at 4am:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Scrappy: a boy, tan and white like his mother</li>
					<li>Junior: a boy, brown and white like his father</li>
					<li>Bella: a girl, silver and gold brindle</li>
					<li>Bella 2: a girl, light tan brindle</li>
					<li>Akiva: a girl, black and gold brindle</li>
					<li>Swisher: a boy, dark tan brindle</li>
				</ol>
			<p>All of the pups are currently in good homes, unfortunately one (Junior) escaped from their yard and is still currently missing; we do not have any current photos of him. The father, Big L, is 4 years old; you will find puppy photos as well as current photos of him located in the <a href="#gallery">gallery</a> as well. </p>
